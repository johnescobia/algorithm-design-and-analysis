# Algorithm Design and Analysis

This project consists of two separate parts.

## Part 1

Examines the time complexities of the following three data structures:

* Hash table
* Self-balancing binary search tree
* Priority queue

The tasks performed by these data structures are insert, search, enqueue, and dequeue. The datasets used in the tasks are of sizes 100, 100000, and 500000 emails.

## Part 2

Examines the experimental results for the following tasks:

* Sort edges according to distance and value with merge sort algorithm
* Calculate shortest distances with Dijikstra’s algorithm
* Produce a minimum spanning tree with Kruskal’s algorithm
* Calculate the maximum benefit with 0/1 Knapsack algorithm

## Built With

* [C++](https://isocpp.org/) - The programming language used
* [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) - The operating system used
* [Geany v1.36](https://www.geany.org/) - The integrated development environment (IDE) used
